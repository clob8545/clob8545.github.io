<h1> Friends the TV Show: Presenting my Argument 3 Ways</h1>

<p> I originally wrote a five paragraph essay presenting my argument for the many reasons the sitcom Friends has maintained popularity through the years. Not many demographics (besides college professors) enjoy essay formatting. If I were considering presenting my argument to an employer, I would embed parts of my written argument into my portfolio. I would separate text boxes so the information was easier and quicker to read, and i would use bootstrap to make the page in my portfolio look aesthetically pleasing.
