<h1> Friends the TV Show: Presenting my Argument 3 Ways</h1>

<p> I originally wrote a five paragraph essay presenting my argument for the many reasons the sitcom Friends has maintained popularity through the years. Not many demographics (besides college professors) enjoy essay formatting. If I were considering presenting my argument to an employer, I would embed parts of my written argument into my portfolio. I would separate text boxes so the information was easier and quicker to read, and I would use bootstrap to make the page in my portfolio look aesthetically pleasing. Making the background and text a bit more playful and 90s themed with CSS would show my skills as well. Putting it directly into my portfolio makes it easy for employers to access.</p>

<p> If I were presenting my work to my family I would use Reveal.JS because they are common people with a short attention span- the slide format would be perfect. I could embed my graph into the presentation and make it even prettier to look at than what I originally had since I know how to customize graphs in Chart.JS. I would use the vertical slides to separate ideas within paragraphs and horizontal slides to separate the pararaphs. I also think the dark background on the class slides lately is very relaxing as opposed to a white background and it would be less intimidating to my family. They'd be impressed that I coded the slide deck rather than using PowerPoint.</p>

<p> If I were presenting this information to Friends fanatics, I would likely build a website with a Friends theme throughout each page. I could add many photos, and possibly consult more sources for deeper research. I would make more graphs and insert them into each page because this demographic would probably be interested in the facts and statistics of the show. If I spent ample time, I could try to use bootstrap to make one of the pages a survey/quiz format using columns and buttons. This would be good for Friends fans to interact with the site and possibly further prove my point, depending on what survey questions I asked.</p>
