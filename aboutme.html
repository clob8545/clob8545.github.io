<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p> Working with data is relatively new to me (I began this track last fall), but has turned into something I get excited about. I will bring an open mind and a strong work ethic to any data science position.
I grew up playing and watching sports, so naturally the passion for sports stuck with me through my college journey. As Information Science is within the College of Media, Communications, and Information, I have been exposed to advertising, public relations, and media through various classes, and became very interested in sports media. In my free time I enjoy cooking and baking with my family, running, and practicing yoga. See <a href="Resume(1)(1).pdf">my resume</a> to for more on my work experience.
