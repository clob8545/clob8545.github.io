	<h2>Comparing fuel efficiency and horsepower</h2>
	<p>Internal combustion engines face a fundamental engineering trade-off: more powerful engines are also less fuel efficient. We can see this relationship clearly in this visualization:</p>

	<script>	
	var spec={
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v4.json",
  "config": {
    "view": {
      "continuousHeight": 300,
      "continuousWidth": 400
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "url": "https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json"
  },
  "encoding": {
    "color": {
      "field": "Origin",
      "type": "nominal"
    },
    "x": {
      "field": "Horsepower",
      "type": "quantitative"
    },
    "y": {
      "field": "Miles_per_Gallon",
      "type": "quantitative"
    }
  },
  "mark": "point"
};
	</script>

	<p>This relationship is interesting because it is non-linear: fuel efficiency drops rapidly with the increase in horsepower.</p>
