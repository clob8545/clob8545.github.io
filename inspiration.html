<h1> My Inspiration Websites</h1>
<a href="https://davidventuri.com/portfolio">David Venturi portfolio</a>
<p> This portfolio has a simplicity that I like while also using a blue/white aesthetic. I want to have buttons on my website similar the the ones on this website. I also like the column organization, but I'm not sure if I want that on mine yet.</p>
<a href="https://priyanka.io/">Prianka Gupta portfolio</a>
<p> I love the large graphic cards used as links to different projects. There is not much text in the home page and I like that. I definitely want to try to make my home page like this.</p>
<a href="https://www.verachen.me/">Vera Chen portfolio</a>
<p> This is similar to Prianka's portfolio, but I like the top menu that allows for an "About me" section separate from the card deck of work and project experiences.</p>
