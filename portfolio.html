<h2>Make-A-Wish</h2>
<h3>Internal Events intern-Summer 2019</h3>
<p>I was able to gain experience in a non-profit office full of dedicated and selfless employees who work to grant wishes for sick children in critical circumstances. Within the internal events sector, I organized data from past events within the foundationâ€™s database, and created social media pamphlets and fliers for upcoming events. I also upheld correspondence with sponsors and donors and set up for larger events during the summer months. This experience strengthened my skills using Microsoft Office as well as interpersonal skills during daily phone calls with other professionals.</p>
<h2>Tech Ethics paper</h2>
