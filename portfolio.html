<h2>TIPS@170</h2>
<h3>Branding intern-Summer 2020</h3>
<p> During a 4 week span, I worked with a team of CU students from a variety of majors to research social media advertising and trends in branding in order to propose and implement a remodeling of the TIPS@170 website and social media accounts. I gained insight on marketing strategy from my peers and got a look at what managing a consulting company looks like from the inside. Additionally I was able to explore wesbite creation and the coding involved in that process.</p>
<h2>Make-A-Wish</h2>
<h3>Internal Events intern-Summer 2019</h3>
<p>I was able to gain experience in a non-profit office full of dedicated and selfless employees who work to grant wishes for sick children in critical circumstances. Within the internal events sector, I organized data from past events within the foundationâ€™s database, and created social media pamphlets and fliers for upcoming events. I also upheld correspondence with sponsors and donors and set up for larger events during the summer months. This experience strengthened my skills using Microsoft Office as well as interpersonal skills during daily phone calls with other professionals.</p>
<h2>Tech Ethics paper</h2>
<p>I consider Clearview technology through three ethical frameworks in this paper, as well as reflect on my own perspective. This course at CU Boulder has built my awareness and interest in information ethics and helped strengthen my own views on the matter. <a href="ethics paper.pdf">Read More</a>
