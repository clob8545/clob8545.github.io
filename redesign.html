  <h1>Redesign:</h1>
  <body>
  	<p1> <a href="clob8545.github.io/Assignment5.html">Home Page</a> 
  	I used "breadcrumb" component on the home page, as well as all the other pages to keep navigation simple and easy.</p1>
  	<p> <a href="clob8545.github.io/portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>
  	I wanted to use card to separate my portfolio items and use pictures as well, like my inspiration page did. I used a button on one of the card to access my referenced paper</p>
  	<p> <a href="clob8545.github.io/aboutme.html">About Me</a>
  	My about me page utilized comlums for the photos to make the layout more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
  	<p> <a href="clob8545.github.io/contact.html">Contact</a>
  	I wanted to keep the contact page simple, so I used buttons for easy access to my GitHub and LinkedIn.
