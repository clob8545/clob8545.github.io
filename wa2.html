GameStop’s recent skyrocket in stock value has been a topic of many controversies, but some of them are more data science-focused than others. An idea that seems to have started from a simple subreddit community has made many big-time traders lose millions of dollars, while a few small-scale day traders have claimed to have made millions as the GameStop share price went from under $20 to over $300 in a matter of days. The two pressing issues directly tied into the world of information science seem to be: Should a trading platform like Robinhood be allowed to restrict buyers? And what will this situation change about stock shorting data accessibility? I see Robinhood’s limitations to be unethical and suspicious, but I see this trend in the money movement to be a completely fair occurrence, as both betting against the success of companies and creating online communities to take action are completely legal and ethical.
	The concept of ethical standards is crucial to consider every time we collect, analyze, or publish data or interact through technology. In this specific event, an independently owned trading platform called Robinhood, as well as some other brokerages, began to limit purchases on certain companies, GameStop included. It seems obvious that the losses of big hedge funds is somehow detrimental to Robinhood, or else they would not have tried to stop the “movement”. Robinhood is not owned by the government and legally can take any action to affect the market as it pleases, but that is not the issue at hand. Just because something is legal, does not mean it is ethical. Limiting the profits of day traders in order to benefit wealthy hedge fund managers and big stakeholder companies is entirely unethical. Of course there are other brokerages for traders to purchase stocks, and many have taken their business elsewhere as the word spread that Robinhood was crooked.
	Although I find Robinhood’s trader limitation to be unethical, I do not see any ethical issues with “betting against” a company’s success and shorting shares. The fact of the matter is GameStop and other companies with dropping stock value are not losing customers because of shorting, but rather traders are shorting because the companies are losing customers. The entire transaction is strategic and the company itself is not being negatively affected by those betting against them. Making money on the depreciating value of a company’s stock is not directly affecting the company’s success, only the traders involved.
	There is a much smaller crowd questioning the ethicality of the Reddit community teaming together to shift the market, but this behavior is equal and ethical to shorting. Reddit has strict moderators that would have stopped any wildly inappropriate or unethical discussion. The data they needed to see which companies were being shorted most was public and very easy to access according to Emily Stewart’s Vox article (The GameStop stock frenzy, explained). Although it is extremely surprising and many people are losing money because of it, the traders buying GameStop stock seem more motivated by their own benefit than by the loss of hedge funds.
	A major takeaway from this catastrophic stock market event is that choosing the brokerage with which you trade plays a huge role in how much money you can invest because of the companies’ potential bias against you, which needs to be further discussed and changed. Additionally, the freedom to bet both on the success and the loss of companies, as well as the access to all the public companies’ stock data are two wonderful features of the market that should be celebrated and respected.
